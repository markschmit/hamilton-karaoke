There’s noth/ing rich folks love more
than go/ing down/town and
slum/min’ it with the poor.
They pull up in their car/riag/es
and gawk

at the stu/dents in the com/mon
just to watch 'em talk.
Take Phil/ip Schuy/ler:
the man is load/ed.
Uh-/oh, but lit/tle does he know
that his daugh/ters

Peg/gy, An/gel/i/ca, E/li/za
sneak in/to the cit/y just
to watch all the guys at
Work, work!

An/gel/i/ca!
Work, work!
E/li/za!
And Peg/gy!
The Schuy/ler sis/ters!

An/gel/i/ca!
Peg/gy!
E/li/za!
Work!

Dad/dy said to be home by sun/down!
Dad/dy does/n’t need to know.
Dad/dy said not to go down/town!
Like I said, you’re free to go.
But- look a/round, look a/round, the
rev/o/lu/tion’s hap/pen/ing in New York

New York
An/gel/i/ca
Work!

It’s bad e/nough dad/dy
wants to go to war,
Peo/ple shout/ing in the square!
It’s bad e/nough there’ll be
vi/o/lence on our shore.
New i/de/as in the air!

Look a/round, look a/round-
An/gel/i/ca, re/mind me what
we’re look/ing for
She’s look/in’ for me!

E/li/za, I’m look/in’ for a mind at
Work, work!
I’m look/in’ for a mind at
Work, work!
I’m look/in’ for a mind at
Work, work!

Whooaaaaa!
Whooaaaaa!
Work!
 
Wooh!
There’s nothin’ like
sum/mer in the cit/y,
some/one in a rush
next to some/one look/in’ pret/ty.

Ex/cuse me, miss,
I know it’s not fun/ny
but your per/fume smells
like your dad/dy’s got mon/ey.
Why you slum/min’ in the cit/y
in your fan/cy heels?

You search/in’ for an ur/chin
who can give you i/deals?
Burr, you dis/gust me.
Ah, so you’ve dis/cussed me
I’m a trust fund ba/by,
you can trust me!

I’ve been read/ing
‘Com/mon Sense’ by Thom/as Paine
so men say that
I’m in/tense or I’m in/sane.

You want a rev/o/lu/tion?
I want a rev/e/la/tion,
so lis/ten to my dec/la/ra/tion:
"We hold these truths
to be self-/ev/i/dent
that all men are cre/at/ed e/qual,"

And when I meet Thom/as Jef/fer/son
Unh!
I’m ‘a com/pel him to in/clude
wom/en in the se/quel!
Work!

Look a/round, look a/round at how
luck/y we are to be a/live right now!
Look a/round, look a/round at how
Luck/y we are to be a/live right now!

His/to/ry is hap/pen/ing in Man/hat/tan
and we just hap/pen to be
in the great/est cit/y in the world!
In the great/est cit/y in the world!
