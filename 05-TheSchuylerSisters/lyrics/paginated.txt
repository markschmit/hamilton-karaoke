[BURR]
There’s nothing rich folks love more
than going downtown and
slummin’ it with the poor.
They pull up in their carriages
and gawk

at the students in the common
just to watch 'em talk.
Take Philip Schuyler:
the man is loaded.
Uh-oh, but little does he know
that his daughters

Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
sneak into the city just
to watch all the guys at—
[COMPANY]
Work, work!

Angelica!
Work, work!
Eliza!
And Peggy!
Work, work!
The Schuyler sisters!

Angelica!
Peggy!
Eliza!
Work!

Daddy said to be home by sundown!
Daddy doesn’t need to know.
Daddy said not to go downtown!
Like I said, you’re free to go.
But—look around, look around, the
revolution’s happening in New York

[ELIZA & PEGGY]
New York
Angelica
[SCHUYLER SISTERS]
Work!
Work!

It’s bad enough daddy
wants to go to war,
People shouting in the square!
It’s bad enough there’ll be
violence on our shore.
New ideas in the air!

Look around, look around—
[ALL MEN]
Look around, look around—
Angelica, remind me what
we’re looking for…
She’s lookin’ for me!

Eliza, I’m lookin’ for a mind at work,
Work, work!
I’m lookin’ for a mind at work!
Work, work!
I’m lookin’ for a mind at work!
Work, work!

Whooaaaaa!
 [SS] Whooaaaaa!
 [SS] Work!
[CHORUS] Work!
 
Wooh!
There’s nothin’ like
summer in the city,
someone in a rush
next to someone lookin’ pretty.

Excuse me, miss,
I know it’s not funny
but your perfume smells
like your daddy’s got money.
Why you slummin’ in the city
in your fancy heels?

You searchin for an urchin
who can give you ideals?
Burr, you disgust me.
Ah, so you’ve discussed me
I’m a trust fund baby,
you can trust me!

I’ve been reading
'Common Sense' by Thomas Paine
so men say that
I’m intense or I’m insane.

You want a revolution?
I want a revelation,
so listen to my declaration:
“We hold these truths
to be self-evident
that all men are created equal,”

And when I meet Thomas Jefferson
Unh!
I’m ‘a compel him to include
women in the sequel!
[WOMEN]
Work!

Look around, look around at how
lucky we are to be alive right now!
[ELIZA & PEGGY]
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now!

[SS] History is happening in Manhattan
and we just happen to be
in the greatest city in the world!
[SS] In the greatest city in the world!
