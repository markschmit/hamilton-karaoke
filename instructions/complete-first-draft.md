# Complete the first draft

Once [initial syncing](initial-sync.md) is complete we need to restore the missing parts and assign the styles.  Once finished we'll have a reasonable idea of what our final video will look like.

## Assigning styles

Read through the song and assign styles based on the [colors we chose earlier](choose-colors.md).

As you go through the song remember to compare it to the 'syllables' or 'paginated' versions so you can see where cues or parallel lyrics were deleted for the initial sync.  As you find those places add the lyrics as described below.

Remember that the first time that any style is used there should be a character cue to let the viewer know which character that style represents.  Ideally this should've been figured out during [page layout](lay-out-lyrics.md), so it shouldn't disrupt the pages now.  Character cues should be marked as 'Fixed' so that lyric-wiping skips them and they should have the same style as the character being cued.

Once the whole song has been assigned styles, click Edit and hit Play to watch what the video looks like so far.


## Adding lyrics

Adding lyrics can be a little tricky at first but is pretty easy once you get the hang of it.

* For cues use the 'Add->Text' button on the first line of who's being cued to create a Fixed line.  Fixed lines don't have lyric wiping.

* For parallel lyrics that duplicate an entire line use the 'Add->Copy' button on the line you wish to duplicate.  This will also duplicate the display/wipe timing.

* For lyrics that comprise just part of a line, add the words to the lines and use the word-splitting button.  This will cause the timing of the split line to be divvied up among the new words.

* For novel lyrics lines add them to the beginning or end of an adjacent line and split words (as above), then select the word on which to split and use 'Lines->Split'.

As you add these you may wish to go into the Display Editing mode (the Edit button above) to set the timing correctly.  KBS assumes that new lyrics being added are sequential so it's important to adjust the lyric timing to be parallel instead.

For more details on editing display and wipe timing see the [Edit Display instructions](edit-display.md).

## Tips

* **Save often**: KBS sometimes crashes and losing lyrics work is frustrating.
* Review [the YouTube tutorial (TODO)]() that covers this part of KBS
* Remember to set the syllables using forward slashes before you split the words
