# Choosing Colors

Color is among the easiest way to distinguish parts from one another without having to clutter the screen with cues throughout the song.  However, choosing colors is difficult.  Karaoke Builder Studio has a strict limit of 16 colors in a karaoke video, and one of those must be the background color.  Additionally every character needs two colors: a pre-wipe and a post-wipe color.  That makes giving each character a separate color difficult - especially if one wants different colors for joint parts (e.g. the Schuyler sisters).

## Creating a template

Within Karaoke Builder Studio you can choose colors in the Styles tab.  Create a style for each song role (major character or group of characters) in the song.  While choosing colors is listed first in the 'process' section, it goes hand-in-hand with doing song layout: if you discover that certain characters need to be split up or joined together it may affect your choice of colors.

Once you're finished selecting pairs colors for each of the roles in the song save the file in the appropriate directory as 'colors.kbt'.

## Tips


* Try to stay consistent from song to song.  Check out some existing songs for examples.
* See if one character's pre-wipe color can be another character's post-wipe color
* Use the costume colors as inspiration (e.g. green for Hamilton, blue for Eliza, purple for Jefferson)
* Use another color for joint parts (e.g. green for Eliza and Peggy together in Schuyler Sisters)
