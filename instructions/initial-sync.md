# Syncing the music to the lyrics

Creating the initial sync of the music to the lyrics is the part of the process that most rewards (and requires) musical and timing ability.  Karaoke Builder Studio requires that the entire song be synced at once, and once you've done it all future editing will be done by hand rather than by tapping out the rhythm.  As such it's useful to try to make this sync as good as is reasonably possible so that less editing is required.

## Creating the sync

Once you've finished [doing page layout](lay-out-lyrics.md), load 'sync.txt' in KBS and browse skim through the pages one last time.  Click 'Audio' in KBS and select the original audio file for use in syncing.

Click 'sync' to start the song playing and use the spacebar to hit 'next word' on each syllable.  Once the song completes KBS will prompt you to save the project file.  Save it as the same name as the directory in which you're working.

## Tips

* Review [the YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L65zSNwrAxM) to watch how it's done.
* Use the spacebar rather than clicking the mouse on the 'next word' button
* You probably want to play it at reduced speed because one can only hit the space bar or click a mouse so quickly.
* Do at least one rehearsal pass through the entire song *knowing* that you won't save the results.  This will help you do better on subsequent passes.
* You'll probably find yourself editing the page layout or syllables after you watch it on-screen for the first time.  That's fine, keep editing until you can do an entire pass and have it feel right.
* It doesn't have to be perfect - you'll inevitably end up editing timing no matter what.
