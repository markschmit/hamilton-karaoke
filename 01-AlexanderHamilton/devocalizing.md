# How to devocalize


1. Open WAV in Audacity
2. Apply to Effects, Remove Vocals
3. Export the reduced version.


Results: Main male vocals reduced.  Chorus is strong (which is fine), Washington and women are strong as well (this is less good).

TODO: Figure out a better approach for removing vocals from this song.
