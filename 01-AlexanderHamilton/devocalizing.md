# How to devocalize Alexander Hamilton

This is the current recommended way to devocalize the song Alexander Hamilton.  If a method that produces better results is discovered, this file should be updated accordingly.

If instrumental tracks are ever released this file can be eliminated.


## Current Best Approach

### Process
1. Open WAV in Audacity
2. Menu: Effects -> Remove Vocals (default: simple, 500, 2000)
3. Export the audio


### Results:
- Main male vocals reduced.
- Chorus is strong (good)
- Problem: Eliza, Washington other women are approximately full volume.
