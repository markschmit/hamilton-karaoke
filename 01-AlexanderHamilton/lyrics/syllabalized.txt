[AARON BURR]
How does a bas/tard, or/phan,
son of a whore and a
Scots/man, dropped in the
mid/dle of a for/got/ten spot
in the Car/ib/be/an

by prov/i/dence, im/pov/er/ished,
in squal/or, grow up
to be a he/ro and a schol/ar?

[JOHN LAURENS]
The ten-/dol/lar Found/ing Fa/ther
with/out a fa/ther
got a lot far/ther

by work/ing a lot hard/er,
by be/ing a lot smart/er,
by be/ing a self-/start/er:
by four/teen, they placed him
in charge of a trad/ing char/ter.

[THOMAS JEFFERSON]
And eve/ry day while slaves
were be/ing slaugh/tered and cart/ed
a/way a/cross the waves,
he strug/gled and kept his guard up.

In/side, he was long/ing
for some/thing to be a part of.
The broth/er was read/y
to beg, steal, bor/row, or bar/ter.

[JAMES MADISON]
Then a hur/ri/cane came
and dev/as/ta/tion reigned.
Our man saw his fu/ture
drip, drip/ping down the drain.

Put a pen/cil to his tem/ple,
con/nect/ed it to his brain
and he wrote his first re/frain,
a tes/ta/ment to his pain.

Well, the word got a/round,
they said, "This kid is in/sane, man."
Took up a col/lec/tion
just to send him to the main/land.

"Get your ed/u/ca/tion,
don’t for/get from whence you came,
and the world's gon/na
know your name.
What’s your name, man?"

[ALEXANDER HAMILTON]
Al/ex/an/der Ham/il/ton.
My name is Al/ex/an/der Ham/il/ton
and there’s a mil/lion things
I ha/ven’t done,
but just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA HAMILTON]
When he was ten his fa/ther split,
full of it, debt-/rid/den.
Two years lat/er, see Al/ex
and his moth/er bed/rid/den,

half-/dead, sit/tin' in their own sick,
the scent thick.
And Al/ex got bet/ter
but his moth/er went quick.

[GEORGE WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cous/in,
the cous/in com/mit/ted su/i/cide,
left him with noth/in’ but ru/ined pride,
some/thing new in/side:

a voice say/ing
"You got/ta fend for your/self."
He start/ed re/treat/in' and read/in'
eve/ry trea/tise on the shelf.

There would have been noth/in’
left to do for some/one less as/tute.
He woulda been dead or des/ti/tute
with/out a cent of res/ti/tu/tion.

Start/ed work/in’, clerk/in’ for
his late moth/er’s land/lord,
trad/in’ sug/ar cane and rum and
all the things he can’t af/ford,
scam/min’ for eve/ry book
he can get his hands on,

plan/nin’ for the fu/ture,
see him now as he stands on
the bow of a ship
head/ed for a new land.
In New York you can be a new man!

In New York you can
be a new man
Just you wait!
In New York you can
be a new man
Just you wait!

In New York you can be a new man
[WOMEN]
In New York
[MEN]
New York
Just you wait!

Al/ex/an/der Ham/il/ton,
we are wait/ing in the wings for you.
You could nev/er back down,
you nev/er learn/ed to take your time!

Oh, Al/ex/an/der Ham/il/ton!
When A/mer/i/ca sings for you,
will they know what you o/ver/came?
Will they know you re/wrote the game?
The world will nev/er be the same, oh.

The ship is in the har/bor now,
see if you can spot him.
An/oth/er im/mi/grant
com/in’ up from the bot/tom.
His en/e/mies de/stroyed his rep,
A/mer/i/ca for/got him.
 
[MULLIGAN+MADISON &
LAFAYETTE-JEFFERSON]
We fought with him.
Me? I died for him.
Me? I trust/ed him.

[ELIZA & ANGELICA & PEGGY\MARIA]
Me? I loved him.
And me?
I’m the damn fool that shot him.

There’s a mil/lion things I ha/ven’t done,
but just you wait!
What’s your name, man?
Al/ex/an/der Ham/il/ton!
