[AARON BURR]
How does a bas/tard, orph/an,
son of a whore and a
Scots/man, dropped in the
mid/dle of a for/got/ten spot
in the Ca/rib/bean

by pro/vi/dence, im/pov/er/ished,
in squa/lor, grow up
to be a he/ro and a sch/olar?

[JOHN LAURENS]
The ten-/dol/lar Found/ing Fa/ther
with/out a fa/ther
got a lot far/ther

by work/ing a lot hard/er,
by be/ing a lot smart/er,
by be/ing a self-/start/er -
by four/teen, they placed him
in charge of a trad/ing charter.

[THOMAS JEFFERSON]
And ev/ery day while slaves
were being slaughtered and carted
away across the waves,
he strugg/led and kept his guard up.

Inside, he was long/ing
for some/thing to be a part of.
The bro/ther was rea/dy
to beg, steal, bor/row, or bar/ter.

[JAMES MADISON]
Then a hurricane came
and devastation reigned.
Our man saw his future
drip, dripping down the drain.

Put a pencil to his temple,
connected it to his brain
and he wrote his first refrain,
a testament to his pain.


Well, the word got around,
they said, “This kid is insane, man.”
Took up a collection
just to send him to the mainland.

“Get your education,
don’t forget from whence you came,
and the world's gonna
know your name.
What’s your name, man?”

[ALEXANDER HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton.
My name is Alexander Hamilton
and there’s a million things
I haven’t done,
but just you wait, just you wait...

[ELIZA HAMILTON]
When he was ten his father split,
full of it, debt-ridden.
Two years later, see Alex
and his mother bed-ridden,

half-dead, sittin' in their own sick,
the scent thick.
And Alex got better
but his mother went quick.

[GEORGE WASHINGTON]
Moved in with a cousin,
the cousin committed suicide,
left him with nothin’ but ruined pride,
something new inside:

a voice saying
“You gotta fend for yourself.”
He started retreatin’ and readin’
every treatise on the shelf.

There would have been nothin’
left to do for someone less astute.
He woulda been dead or destitute
without a cent of restitution.

Started workin’, clerkin’ for
his late mother’s landlord,
tradin’ sugar cane and rum and
all the things he can’t afford,
scammin’ for every book
he can get his hands on,

plannin’ for the future,
see him now as he stands on
the bow of a ship
headed for a new land.
In New York you can be a new man!

In New York you can
be a new man—
Just you wait!
In New York you can
be a new man—
Just you wait!

In New York you can be a new man—
[WOMEN]
In New York—	 
[MEN]
New York—
Just you wait!

Alexander Hamilton,
we are waiting in the wings for you.
You could never back down,
you never learned to take your time!

Oh, Alexander Hamilton!
When America sings for you,
will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh.

The ship is in the harbor now,
see if you can spot him.
Another immigrant
comin’ up from the bottom.
His enemies destroyed his rep,
America forgot him.
 
[MULLIGAN+MADISON &
LAFAYETTE+JEFFERSON]
We fought with him.
Me? I died for him.
Me? I trusted him.

[ELIZA & ANGELICA & PEGGY\MARIA]
Me? I loved him.
And me?
I’m the damn fool that shot him.

There’s a million things I haven’t done,
but just you wait!
What’s your name, man?
Alexander Hamilton!
